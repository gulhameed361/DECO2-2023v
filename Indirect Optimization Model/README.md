# DECO2

DECarbonisation Option Optimisation (DECO2) is an optimal decarbonisation framework developed as part of a British Council-funded Trilateral Research Initiative between University of Surrey, University of Nottingham Malaysia, and University of Tokyo, with project parters De La Sall University (Philippines), Monash University Malaysia, Malaysian Green Technology Centre and Aria Sustainability. 

The framework combines rigorous mathematical programming models (mixed-integer linear programming) to determine optimal pathways to decarbonisation through implementation of carbon apture and utilisation, negative emissions technologies, and alternative energy sources for optimal energy transitions. Please read the user manual in the main folder for information on the formulation and how the inputs work. For details on the partnership, please visit our site:
